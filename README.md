# Design-Principles
Encapsulate what varies.
Favor composition over inheritance.
Program to interfaces, not tp implementations.
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Depend on abstractions, not on concrete classes.
Talk only to your friends.
Don't call us, we will cal you.
